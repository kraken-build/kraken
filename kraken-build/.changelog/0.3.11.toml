type = "fix"
description = "fix `PoetryPythonBuildSystem`, with Poetry 1.2.0 we must update an existing package source rather than appending one if it has the same name otherwise it complains. Also `poetry env info -p` will not always return a path even if Poetry commands succeed, that is because it may fall back to a virtual environment that is com[atible with the required Python version if the \"main\" Python installation is not."
