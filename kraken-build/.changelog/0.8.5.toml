type = "fix"
description = "Fixed a bug where the preprocessed Dockerfile for Kaniko would attempt to establish the `/run/secrets` symlink for every `RUN` command, even if that command was not run by the root user. In this case, the `RUN` command would fail as the permission to create the symlink are missing. We now employ a heuristic to determine if a `RUN` command would be run as the `root` user, and if that is not the case we do not add the setup and teardown suffix around the `RUN` command. Note that this means `RUN` commands that do not run as root can not read secrets from `/run/secrets` (the standard Docker secrets interface) but only from `/kaniko/secrets`."
