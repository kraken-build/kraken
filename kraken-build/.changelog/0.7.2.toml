type = "fix"
description = "The task graph now keeps track of tasks that return `TaskStatusType.STARTED` and will reset their status when the graph targets are set (`TaskGraph.set_target()`) which is usually after the TaskGraph was deserialized. This will ensure that background tasks are run again if another task that has not yet run is executed in a resumed execution."
