description = "Re-implement `GitignoreSyncTask`, simplifying the code by a lot (e.g. no more tracking of a generated content hash) and cache a subset of tokens from gitignore.io to distribute them as part of kraken-std. The old begin/end markers we used in gitignore files before is still supported. We also no longer sort the gitignore file entries."
