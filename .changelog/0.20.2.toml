type = "improvement"
description = "Deprecate the `Project.subproject(load)` &ndash; Instead, a new `Project.subproject(mode)` parameter was added that can be set to `\"empty\"`, `\"execute\"` or `\"if-exists\"`, The `\"if-exists\"` mode behaves exactly like the `Project.subproject(load=False)` option. A new semantic is introduced with the `\"empty\"` mode, which creates a sub-project but does not care if the directory associated with the project exists or if a build script exists as the script will not be executed."

type = "fix"
description = "Fixed the address selectors that we fall back to if no selectors are specified on the command-line: They were `[\":\", \":**:\"]`, referencing the root projects and all it's sub-projects, when it should really be `[\".\", \"**:\"]`, which references the current project and all of it's sub-projects."
