type = "fix"
description = "Fixed a bug in the ordering of Python interpreters when resolving an appropriate installation for the Kraken build environment. We now rely on the order returned by `kraken.common.findpython.get_candidates()`, which already attempts to be a bit clever in the order it returns candidates (e.g. `python3` over `python3.X` over `python3.X.Y` over installations in `~/.pyenv/versions`)."
