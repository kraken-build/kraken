type = "breaking change"
description = "(Minor) Passing `:task` to the Kraken CLI now _only_ runs the specified task in the _root project_. In order to run the task in the current and all of its subprojects, one should specify `task` or `**:task`, which are now treated equivalent by `Context.resolve_tasks()`. To run the task only in the current project but not its subprojects, one must specift `.:task`."

type = "improvement"
description = "Support intuitively correct resolution of task addresses from subdirectories with respect to the `-p,--project-dir` assuming a 1:1 mapping between directory structure and Kraken project structure. This ensures that `kraken run -p .. task` fails with an error saying that the address `:sub` does not exist when trying to resolve `:sub:**:task`, assuming that the current directory is called `sub/`. On the other hand, it enables using `kraken run -p .. ..:task` to refer to the task in the project of the parent of the current directory. (Keep in mind that the `-p,--project-dir` argument is automatically passed when Kraken is invoked through [kraken-wrapper](https://github.com/kraken-build/kraken-wrapper) to enable a smooth experience when working from multiple directories in the same Kraken project)."
